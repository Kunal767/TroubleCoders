            A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
            automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of
            operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A
            "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment
            required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be
            used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or
            computer cluster.

            Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes
            simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial
            robots and computer-aided design, and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile
            devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other
            computers and their users.

            Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like
            the abacus aided people in doing calculations. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices
            were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical
            machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic
            calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late
            1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip
            technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s.
            The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with MOS
            transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital
            Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.

            Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central
            processing unit (CPU) in the form of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) microprocessor, along with some type
            of computer memory, typically MOS semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic
            and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to
            stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output
            devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the
            2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and
            they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.
            According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known use of the word "computer" was in 1613 in a book
            called The Yong Mans Gleanings by English writer Richard Braithwait: "I haue [sic] read the truest computer
            of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short
            number." This usage of the term referred to a human computer, a person who carried out calculations or
            computations. The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. During the
            latter part of this period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their
            male counterparts.[1] By 1943, most human computers were women.[2]

            The Online Etymology Dictionary gives the first attested use of "computer" in the 1640s, meaning "one who
            calculates"; this is an "agent noun from compute (v.)". The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the use
            of the term to mean "'calculating machine' (of any type) is from 1897." The Online Etymology Dictionary
            indicates that the "modern use" of the term, to mean "programmable digital electronic computer" dates from
            "1945 under this name; [in a] theoretical [sense] from 1937, as Turing machine".[3]

            The Ishango bone, a bone tool dating back to prehistoric Africa.
            Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence
            with fingers. The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids
            throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of
            items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[4][5] The use of counting
            rods is one example.


            The Chinese suanpan (ÁÆóÁõò). The number represented on this abacus is 6,302,715,408.
            The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in
            Babylonia as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been
            invented. In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers
            moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.[6]


            The Antikythera mechanism, dating back to ancient Greece circa 150‚Äì100 BC, is an early analog computing
            device.
            The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog computer, according to Derek J.
            de Solla Price.[7] It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the
            Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to
            c.‚Äâ100 BC. Devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not
            reappear until a thousand years later.

            Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use.
            The planisphere was a star chart invented by Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ in the early 11th century.[8] The
            astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often
            attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an
            analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An
            astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer[9][10] and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of
            Isfahan, Persia in 1235.[11] Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar
            astrolabe,[12] an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine[13] with a gear train and gear-wheels,[14]
            c.‚Äâ1000 AD.

            The sector, a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication
            and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th
            century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation. </p>
